During the [2014 hackathon in Zurich](https://digitalfestival.ch/en/HACK/), 
my collegue [Teseo Schneider](https://cs.nyu.edu/~teseo/) and I developed an 
iPad app for babies, where they can explore different colorful geometric shapes 
and learn new things.

You can find more information about this app on its 
[official website](http://www.fourtoddler.altervista.org).

If you want to participate in the project, please let me know.
