During the [2014 hackathon in Zurich](https://digitalfestival.ch/en/HACK/), 
my collegue Teseo Schneider and I developed an iPad app for babies, where they 
can explore different colourful geometric shapes and learn new things.

You can find more information about this app on its 
[official website](http://www.fourtoddler.altervista.org).

If you want to participate in the project, please let me know.
