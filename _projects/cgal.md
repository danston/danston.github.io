During my internship in Inria Sophia-Antipolis, France in 2013, I started developing 
a C++ package with an efficient and robust implementation of some 2D closed-form 
generalized barycentric coordinates (GBC) for the Computational Geometry 
Algorithms Library (CGAL), whose final version was published in 2014.

Later, I also developed a few other packages.

You can find more information about gbc package
[here](http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Barycentric_coordinates_2).
