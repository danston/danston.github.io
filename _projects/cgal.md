Implementation of various [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org) packages.

During my 2013 internship in [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/sophia), 
I started developing a C++ package with an efficient and robust 
implementation of some 2D closed-form generalized barycentric coordinates  
for the [Computational Geometry Algorithms Library](https://www.cgal.org) (CGAL), 
whose final version was published in 2014.

You can find more information about this package
[here](http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Barycentric_coordinates_2).

In 2018, during [Google Summer of Code 2018](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/organizations/5076776166359040/) with [CGAL project](https://www.cgal.org) my student 
[Thien Hoang](http://www.tvhoang.com) and I developed a C++ package with a generalized 
region growing algorithm for shape detection both in 2D and 3D.
