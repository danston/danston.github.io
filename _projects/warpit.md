I was interested in efficient implementation of the image warping technique using 
subdivision of the underneath triangle mesh. As a result, I have currently available 
a stand-alone image warping tool for Mac OS and Windows operating systems.

You can find more information about this program on its official
[github page](https://github.com/danston/warpit).
