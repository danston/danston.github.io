Dmitry is an outstanding professional: great programming and mathematical skills come together with high ethical standards. One can count on him once he committed to something, and it will be done on time: this quality together with his technical skills will be of high value to a company or a research institute that needs people to rely on when “things get tough”/project is not going as expected. Dmitry is a constant learner (you can find his side projects here: https://www.anisimovdmitry.com/) and a resourceful doer: not only did he conducted a great research during his PhD in the field of applied mathematics and computer graphics (PhD title: “Analysis and New Constructions of Generalized Barycentric Coordinates in 2D”, but he co-organised (we did this together) events in Lugano for PhD students (for up to 50 people), initiated and created with Teseo Schneider an app for kids (http://www.fourtoddler.altervista.org/), another safety-app with Randolf Scharfig (http://www.securexapp.altervista.org/), and many other side projects. Finally, Dmitry is a great team player and a good friend: you can count on him when you need it the most. I highly value Dmitry and if he decides to move to Berlin, he will be the first person I consider if I need a technical professional and highly reliable partner/colleague."
